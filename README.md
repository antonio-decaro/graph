# graph
This repository contains classes and functions to operate with graphs.

The subpackage implementation, contains different implementations of abstract class Graph in module core.py:
  - Adjacent List
  - Adjacent Matrix

The module core.py is essentially the core of the package, it contains:
  - Graph class, that is an abstraction of a Graph
  - Node class, that can be extended by other users.

The module function.py contains different utility functions like shortest path, checking dag, vertex cover and so on.
